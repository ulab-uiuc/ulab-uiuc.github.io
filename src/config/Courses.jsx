    title: "CS598: Topics in LLM Agents – 2025 Spring",
    description:
      "This course offers an in-depth exploration of the fascinating field of LLM agents. Designed as a seminar-style course, it guides students through the fundamental methods that power LLM agents and examines their practical applications in real-world contexts. We begin with an introduction to the core concepts of LLM agents, then delve into the latest research on building agents, covering topics such as memory, planning, reasoning, and more. We will also explore the interface between LLM agents and their environments, including areas like retrieval-augmented generation and tool learning. Finally, we will examine impactful applications of LLM agents, with ample opportunities for collaborative brainstorming sessions. The course is structured around reading cutting-edge research papers, student-led presentations, interactive discussions, and collaborative semester-long projects. This approach aims to foster a deep understanding of latest LLM agent research and equip students with skills to contribute to research in relevant fields.",

    title: "CS598: Deep Learning with Graphs – 2024 Fall",
    description:
      "This course delves into the exciting field of deep learning for graph-structured data. This course is designed to equip students with an understanding of fundamental principles, classic models, and cutting-edge algorithms, along with practical applications. The curriculum will commence with an exploration of the foundationals, encompassing graph concepts, deep learning fundamentals, node embeddings, and graph neural networks. Building upon this groundwork, the course will progress to advanced topics, including the practical guide for GNN implementation, theories of graph neural networks, and specialized areas such as heterogeneous graphs, knowledge graphs, reasoning mechanisms, and subgraph mining. Moreover, the course will delve into contemporary applications, including graph-based recommender systems, generative models for graphs, graph transformers, and building scalable graph learning systems. The instructional approach will blend traditional lectures, student-led presentations, interactive seminar-style discussions, and collaborative semester-long projects. Through this multifaceted approach, students will not only grasp the knowledge but also develop analytical skills by reading and critiquing research papers, discussing and presenting ideas, and contributing to collaborative projects.",
